# Data Science Project Estructure

This document provides a guideline to a standard Data Science Project with the most common steps explained. We assume the objective of the project is taken and the data is collected. We will focus on data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning and model evaluating.

Also, this guide is focusing on supervised machine learning problems, but most part of it is applicable on unsupervised problems.
